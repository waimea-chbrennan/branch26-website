## Project Description

Nelson Amateur Radio Club (referred to as B26/ Branch 26) needs a public facing website to promote the hobby of amateur radio to the public, giving them the opportunity to join the club. Members should be able to post activities to the site with some being private to confirmed members while others should be able to post important activities to be public.

- Sign in area for members.
- Members only page allowing posting and viewing of "small" activities.
- Prominent members can post large official club meetings that are open to the public.
- Showcase of amateur radio to the public (ie historic activities) that make the hobby look appealing.
- Strong call to action to for public to join *our* club.
