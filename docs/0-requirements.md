# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

Branch 26 needs a website! They need a way to advertise the hobby of amateur radio to the public and encourage interested people to join the club and for members to communicate the existence and details of various activities to the public and other members for advertising and coordination purposes.

## End-User Requirements

Replace this text with a description of your typical end-users and their specific needs / expectations / requirements.
This site will have to cater to the general public and to the members of the club which have a wide demographic. There is a left skew in the age with many members being older men but most people who join are often younger and from a wider background. Some users are extremely tech savvy while others are not and this range will have to be considered in development. Members and the general public will likely access the site from mobile or desktop.

## Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.
The website will have a member login functionality that will restrict access to certain portions of the site (such as viewing member only activities or posting activities) to active club members. Activities should be able to be posted with different titles, descriptions and starting and ending dates (may run more than a day) and a member may have many activities posted at once. The club committee should be able to remove or edit details of any activity and to have some ability to edit the content of pages on the site.

# Relevant Implications

## Functionality Implications

Functionality implications are all about the website being able to perform it's intended duty *well*. (meaning no strange errors or bugs and the user can actually do what they wanted to)

### Relevance to the System

Replace this text with an explanation of why the implication is relevant to this particular project.

### Impact / Considerations

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.



## Usability Implications

Usability is about how easy it is for the user to do the task that they wanted without pulling their hair out. If functionality is about if things are possible to perform then usability is about how easy and clear to understand the actions needed to perform them are.

### Relevance to the System

### Impact / Considerations

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.



## Aesthetic Implications

Aesthetic implications are all about whether the website actually looks okay (or not). If the users like how it looks, and conventions are met such as readable fonts and matching colors with design features like alignment repetition etc then the aesthetics are a success.

## Privacy Implications

Privacy Implications are about making sure that your user's data is held and processed safely and securely in your site. To meet them, you should try to collect as little data about your users as possible and ensuring what you do collect is properly secure and held to NZ privacy laws.

### Relevance to the System

The members of branch 26 will have some data held on the website such as callsign and password for login and email and phone number as well as name for contacting them. This needs to be held and processed/served at a level of moderate security (as high as reasonable) as this is a lot of data that can be used to identify people. We also want to keep their passwords as safe as possible.

### Impact / Considerations

- When storing the user's secured info in our database we can perform password hashing to ensure that no-one that gets access to the database (me included) can see the member's passwords which may be used in other places which would compromise their security. 
- We can use obfuscation tools when displaying our designated contacts info to prevent web crawlers harvesting it.


## Accessibility Implications

Accessibility Implications are all about making sure that all users can use the site even if they have compromised abilities or are on an unconventional device. Therefore, we need to ensure that we cater for those with impaired vision (color blindness, dyslexia etc) or those using the site one handed on mobile or even with assistance such as a screen reader.

### Relevance to the System

There are a lot of elderly members in the club and the website should also be able to be used by the general public so we *will* have to cater for these users with various needs.

### Impact / Considerations

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.



## End-User Implications

End-user implications are about meeting the users specific needs for using the site. This means that they can get what they came to do done, while catering to their expectations and case requirements (such as multi-platform device support). If they are happy and feel catered for / included then you have met the End-User implications.
