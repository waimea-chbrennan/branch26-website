## Addressing Relevant Implications

### Functionality Implications

I have rigorously tested this site throughout the design process to get to this point and I am proud that this website can be a useful tool for the branch. Club members are happy with the addition of the resources page.

### Usability Implications

I am happy with the usability of key areas of the site due to key design areas such as the activities system which are extremely easy to post and see due to being on the same page. I have also designed and ensured that the path from the home page to the contact us page is very easy to help meet the key requirement of it being easy for others to join the club.

### Aesthetic Implications

I have done testing with the committee and the general public to establish a good colour scheme which makes the website friendly which the general public agrees with. I have also chosen my images well to make the website friendly again (see hamcram page).

### Privacy Implications

I believe I did well to address what I needed to ensure the users privacy. I believe using the werkzeug.security module with hashing and salting for password hashing is more than adequate to store the users passwords and I have also randomly generated the user passwords when their account is created for them which is a secure by default approach meaning there are no insecure passwords to be breached by default anyways.

### Accessibility Implications

I have refined my semantic structure of my website to give screen readers and any other accessibility tools the best ability to navigate and use my site. I have made a consious effort to seperate roles of pages to try and balance clutter and cognitive load (ie separating activities and resources) to try and make the website make sense to all club members and public.

## Overall Review
I am very happy with how this project has progressed over time, especially during the stages of developing key functionality as I believe I have been able to support key functionality by adding key quality of life improvements such as the email system to add members easily which will promote the use of the system over time. However, the design phase in sprint 3 deserved some more work that I was unable to provide due to various reasons.
